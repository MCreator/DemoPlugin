One could add 1.12.2 support in this plugin by creating the same directory structure as in
../1.14.4 folder, but with code generator templates for 1.12.2.

One can add support for other generators too by adding &lt;plugin root&gt;/&lt;generator name&gt; folder
and populating it with templates for plugin features.
