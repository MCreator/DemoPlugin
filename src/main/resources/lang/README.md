# Lang folder

In this folder, localisations are defined.

## Localisation files

In order to add a localisation entry, you need to have at least the English file (`texts.properties`). 
Then, you can add support for other languages by adding `_language_COUNTRY` using the two letters corresponding.

You can see an example with the English and French files.

## Entries

To translate a text, you need to follow this template:

`[key]=[The text to display]`

The `key` is the unlocalized text used by MCreator to get the translated text in different languages.
